Hello... it's been quite a while since we've talked. Hello... I know I haven't been the best lately. I wanted to be a better brother, better son.  Hello I've been in the bushes for a while now... Hello if you ever hear my call for help do call me on a toll free number... Hello... I know I haven't been the best. Hello I'd like to make a confession... Hello... I think I may have killed my girlfriend.... Hello I never thought I'd say this but... Does anyone have a bathroom pass I could borrow..? Hello.. im trying my best to be a good sandwich... Hello I've never realised the value of PB&j on my author... Until now... Hello.. I always thought we could be a thing.. but you never knew my thoughts and you listened to my friends... Hello I set out to be successful... with my diaper-selling business but you.. stopped me... you promised me you would love me... even in my toughest times when I was addicted to my diapers... you showed me the food.. humans eat.. 

Hello... this is a hard time for me writing this song... HELLO.. I PROMISE I WILL BE NICER TO SEALS.... Hello.. do you hear me regrets..? Hello... have I always been so annoying...? Hello... Hello...
